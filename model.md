## Process

In the concept introduced by Deming, the Process Steps participate in a process of continuous improvement, or **Kaizen**. To this end, counting on SPC assistance, management shall establish operational definitions, perform sampling, measurements and control charts to reflect the process quality. Process Steps should be designed and executed according to skills and activities required by the Process.

```
"The process is divided into steps; the work enters in one step, changes its
state and continues, having as a client the next step. At each stage there is
production, that is, something happens, causing different output, until the
final stage, intended for the consumer."
```

|    | Step 1 ► Step 2 ► ... ► Consumer |
|----|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1  | The Process should be divided into Steps. |
| 2  | The work enters a Step, changes its state, and proceeds with the next Step as a client. |
| 3  | At each Step, something happens in the assets entering a Step, causing their exit in a different state. |
| 4  | Each Step incorporates continual improvement of methods and procedures to meet subsequent Steps. |
| 5  | Each Step cooperates with the next and the previous, seeking optimization.  |
| 6  | The Steps establish long-term trust relationships: this is what I can do for you; here's what you can do for me.  |
| 7  | The final Step is for the consumer, purchaser of the product or service.|
| 8  | The Steps work together, aiming at quality and customer satisfaction.|
| 9  | Consumer is the main link of the production line. |
| 10 | The Process is a closed loop that consumes products of nature and transforms them into other products of nature.|
