# Model

Every 30 years, since the invention of the Ford factory in ‘20s, there have been major transformations in business management. Deming in the ‘50s started the revolution in Asian countries with the SPC, followed by JIT and TPM. In the ‘80s, Goldratt brought Westerners back to the top with the Theory of Constraints. It is now important to enhance the information
system with continuous improvement towards the global optimum. 

This model presents an Information System organized in layers, which offers an alternative for an ubiquitous language to assist investors and managers from companies of all types and sizes, involved in making business decisions.

## Process

Following the original manufacturing concepts introduced by Ford & Deming, process steps should be designed and executed according to the skills and activities required by the Process. A continuous improvement, or **Kaizen**, should be established with SPC, TPM and TOC assistance. The company management shall establish operational definitions, perform sampling, measurements and charts to reflect the process quality.

Deming's original text below is detailed into nine table rules shown below. But definitely, the Process is not a line, but a circle, with the planet located at the beginning and end of it. For this reason, a tenth rule is added to certify the ciclic nature of the Process.

```
        "The process is divided into steps; the work enters in one step, changes its
        state and continues, having as a client the next step. At each stage there is
        production, that is, something happens, causing different output, until the
        final stage, intended for the consumer."
```

|    | Step 1 ► Step 2 ► ... ► Consumer |
|---:|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1  | The Process should be divided into Steps. |
| 2  | The work enters a Step, changes its state, and proceeds with the next Step as a client. |
| 3  | At each Step, something happens in the assets entering a Step, causing their exit in a different state. |
| 4  | Each Step incorporates continual improvement of methods and procedures to meet subsequent Steps. |
| 5  | Each Step cooperates with the next and the previous, seeking optimization.  |
| 6  | The Steps establish long-term trust relationships: this is what I can do for you; here's what you can do for me.  |
| 7  | The final Step is for the consumer, purchaser of the product or service.|
| 8  | The Steps work together, aiming at quality and customer satisfaction.|
| 9  | Consumer is the main link of the production line. |
| 10 | The Process is a closed loop that consumes products of nature and transforms them into other products of nature.|


## TPM Total Productive Maintenance

The company's overall performance has intermediate indices that provide a selective and detailed analysis of the sources of problems. TPM has turned time into a decision support tool that brings together concepts as diverse as stopping machines, wasted labor, and faulty parts.

![TPM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/171900614-65f44b36-b1fb-446e-a0c6-eb1e28ca89cd.png)

|  TPM    |    Index         | gpi = ati * oti * opi * zti                       |
|-----|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| gpi | Global Performance      | The multiplication of the four partial indices. It corresponds to the overall performance, considering all sort of issues, failures and wastes registered in the Process. |
| ati | Available Time          | Equivalent to Available Time divided by Working Time, that is, the amount of time that machines and equipment do not fail and production can occur. |
| oti | Operating Time          | Equals Operating Time divided by Available Time. Considers the portion of time without a breakdown in production, due to lack of personnel or failure in operation.  |
| opi | Operational Performance | This is equivalent to the multiplication of Operating Speed by the Production Time Index, reflecting operational speed losses.  |
| zti | Zero Defect             | Equivalent to Zero Defect Time, producing only perfect products, divided by Productive Time. This represents the portion of time free from rework on defective products.  |
